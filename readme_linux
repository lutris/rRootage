This file specifies the differences between the Linux and Windows versions of rRootage.

Installation:
Download the data files, and the executable for your platform. Put rr in this directory.
On most systems, simply open a console, switch to root, and run ./install.sh.

If that doesn't work, you can install manually. Copy rr_share/* to
/usr/share/games/rRootage, rr to /usr/bin and make sure everything works.

Running:
Type rr to start the game. The command-line line switches listed in
readme_e.txt should all work.

Compiling:
Install the OpenGL development libraries. (This is the hard part.)
Install libBulletML. (http://user.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~s31552/wp/libbulletml/index_en.html 
Compiling should be simple. Copy the resulting .a file to /usr/lib)
Install SDL_mixer.
Compile with "make"
The file "rr" goes in your path, and all directories except src go in 
/usr/share/games/rRootage. src is unneeded after compiling.

Uninstall:
Remove the directory /usr/share/games/rRootage, the file /usr/bin/rr and the file ~/.rr.prf.

The original game was created by Kenta Cho. (http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/windows/rr_e.html) 
It was ported to Linux by Evil Mr Henry. (evilmrhenry@yahoo.com)
